# dinner-GuestList
Responsive Dinner Guest List Planner

Purpose: Practice creating and working with arrays based on user input + resposive design.

Functionality:
📖 Capture guest names entered by user
➕ Add user name to a Guest List array (up to a maximum number of 10 guests)
📱 Display Guest List array and update as user enters guest names
💯 If Guest List array is holding the max value (10 guest names) and the user attempts to input an 11th name, give them the option to replace an existing guest with a new guest.
👍 If user chooses to replace a guest, they are prompted to enter the name of the existing guest they wish to replace.
💌 If the user inputs a valid existing guest name, the displayed list is updated with that name removed and the new guest name displayed in its place.

This webpage is also my first fully responsive project.
